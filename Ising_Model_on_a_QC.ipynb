    "### The Variational Method in Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "In order to understand why VQE works, we must first understand the variational method for approximating the ground state energy in quantum mechanics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a (hermitian) operator, $H$, where $H$ is a Hamiltonian of a system. $H$ has a corresponding set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which we can denote as pairs: $\\{|n\\rangle, E_n \\}$. (Here, $E_n$ is the corresponding eigenenergy to eigenvector $|n\\rangle$. That is: $H|n\\rangle = E_n |n\\rangle$.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider a general vector, $|\\psi\\rangle$. We denote the expecation value of $H$ for this vector to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\langle{H}\\rangle_{|\\psi\\rangle} = \\langle\\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can expand $H$ in terms of it's eigenstates as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    H = \\sum_n E_n \\langle n | n \\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, substituting this expression into (1):\n",
    "$$ \\langle H \\rangle_{|n \\rangle } = \\langle \\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\psi | (\\sum_n E_n |n\\rangle \\langle n | )|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_n E_n |\\langle \\psi|n\\rangle|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this quantity is effectively a weighted average of all the possible energies, which is exactly what we would expect. We can view the quantity $|\\langle \\psi | n\\rangle|^2$ as the probability of obtaining energy $E_n$, meaning that the quantity $|\\langle \\psi|n \\rangle|^2$ must be non-negative because it is a probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "We might expect there to be a $| min \\rangle$, such that $E_{min}$, the corresponding eigenenergy, is the smallest possible energy. That is: $E_{min} \\leq E_i$ $\\forall i \\in \\{n \\}$. This $E_{min}$ would be the ground state energy of the system. We expect that there is therefore a state, $| min \\rangle$ such that:\n",

When we are in the ground state, we would expect to have a $|\\psi \\rangle$ such that $\\langle H \\rangle_{|\\psi \\rangle} = E_{min}$. For this to be true, we would need $|\\langle \\psi|n \\rangle|^2 = 1$ when $|n\\rangle = |min\\rangle$, and $|\\langle \\psi|n \\rangle|^2 = 0$ otherwise. Using $| \\psi \\rangle = |min \\rangle$ would do exactly that. This is because $|min \\rangle$ is assumed to be part of our eigenvector set, so $\\langle min|n \\rangle = 0$ for all $n \\neq min$. \n",

This takes the problem of calculating the ground state energy and turns it into an optimization problem. \n",

In practice, this method can involve many parameters, and can be quite computationally intensive. \n"

    "<img src=\"Ising_Model_on_a_QC_Images/VQE Scheme.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the VQE algorithm, we utilize the variational principle to find the ground state energy and ground state eigenfunction of a given Hamiltonian. In short, here's how the algorithm works: First, given a Hamiltonian, we decide on an ansatz, or a trial wave function, which is a function of some variational parameters. We use the quantum computer to calculate $\\langle H \\rangle$ for this ansatz state. We then move to the classical computer, and apply an optimization routine in order to minimize the value of $\\langle H \\rangle$ based on the variational parameters given. After optimizing the parameters, we construct a new trial wave function, and calculate $\\langle H \\rangle$ again. This process is repeated until $\\langle H \\rangle$ is sufficiently minimized. Then, we have found a possible ground state energy and ground state!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on the ansatz\n",
    "In VQE, we are given a Hamiltonian matrix, $H$. Using some prior knowledge, we generate some **ansatz** that is a function of some variational parameter. This ansatz is exactly the trial wave function we use in the variational method. A simple example of a one-parameter ansatz could be:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ U(\\theta) |0 \\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    " Where $U(\\theta)$ is the rotation matrix given by:\n",
    " $$ \\begin{bmatrix} cos(\\theta/2) & -sin(\\theta/2) \\\\\n",
    " sin(\\theta/2) & cos(\\theta/2)\\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    " Depending on the Hamiltonian, we may choose a different ansatz. To build a better intuitive understanding, let's examine this ansatz given above. Note that $U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle$ can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ U(\\theta) |0 \\rangle = cos(\\theta/2) |0 \\rangle + sin(\\theta /2) | 1 \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Notice that this is a general 1 qubit state. So, this ansatz allows us to access any superposition of $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$ (so long as there is no phase between them). In computing, we can obviously add more parameters, such as using the fully general $U(\\theta, \\phi, \\lambda)$, but the more parameters we have, the more computationally intensive. \n",

Recall from linear algebra that for a given matrix $A$ and a constant $b$, the matrices $bA$ and $A$ have the same eigenvectors, and the eigenvalues of $bA$ are just the eigenvalues of $A$ multiplied by $b$. Thus, when we calculate the ground state, the ground state itself will be fine, but we need to scale the ground state energy by $J$ to ensure we get the correct energy. Generally, the ratio $h/J$ will tell us enough."

    "#### Measurements for $\\langle H \\rangle $\n",

    "In order to calculate the energy, $\\langle H \\rangle $, we need to calculate just two matrix elements: $\\langle \\psi | \\sigma_i^z \\sigma_{i+1}^z| \\psi \\rangle $ and $ \\langle \\psi | \\sigma_i^x|\\psi \\rangle $. By convention, our states are already polarized in the $z$ direction, so the calculation of $\\langle \\psi | \\sigma_i^z \\sigma_{i+1}^z| \\psi \\rangle $ is quite simple. We can run the following circuit:\n",

However, once we take the measurement using the circuit above, we can calculate $\\langle \\psi | \\sigma_i^z \\sigma_{i+1}^z| \\psi \\rangle $! If we return $|00 \\rangle, | 11 \\rangle$, the value is $+1$. If it is $|01 \\rangle, |10 \\rangle$, it is $-1$. We might ask if we can simply apply a $\\sigma^z$ operator on both qubits and measure it. This unfortunately does not work because measurements do not capture phases, and a negative sign is just a phase. \n",
